# Production Engineering - Portfolio Site

Backend: Flask, Python
Frontend: Jinja, Javascript

This is my in-progress portfolio site for the MLH / Meta PE Fellowship.

Note: Basic templates from https://github.com/Amandaleeanne/MLH_Portfolio_Website_WK1, where I collaborated with 2 wonderful teammates!

## Installation

Make sure you have python3 and pip installed

Create and activate virtual environment using virtualenv
```bash
$ python -m venv python3-virtualenv
$ source python3-virtualenv/bin/activate
```

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install all dependencies!

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Create a .env file using the example.env template (make a copy using the variables inside of the template)

Start flask development server
```bash
$ export FLASK_ENV=development
$ flask run
```

You should get a response like this in the terminal:
```
❯ flask run
 * Environment: development
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

You'll now be able to access the website at `localhost:5000` or `127.0.0.1:5000` in the browser! 

*Note: The portfolio site will only work on your local machine while you have it running inside of your terminal.* 

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. 

Universal tasks are tasks that will be merged into the main branch for all other branches to update from. Portfolio tasks are custom tasks that should live in a separate branch. Each person within the group will have their own branch that contains things specific to them and their portfolio. Pull requests are still required for review and feedback.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
